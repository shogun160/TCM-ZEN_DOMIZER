# **Randomizer for The Crew Motorfest Grand Races**

Available categories:
- Street Tier 1
- Street Tier 2
- Hypercar
- Drift
- Racing
- AGP
- Motocross
- Rally
- Rally Raid
- Monster Truck

⚠️ *For Drift there are only a few cars available at the moment (Hoonigan & Mitsubishi). This is because steering will block for most other drift cars when using direct mode or high dynamic maxlock. More cars may be added later.*

Thanks to [@wbcolon](https://github.com/wbcolon) for integrating the Grandrace rotation and automatic matching of categories.  
And of course to the [motorfe.st project](https://github.com/calamity-inc/motorfe.st/) for the rotation logic itself.

**Version:** v2.4  
**Carlist:** Season 6 – 21.05.2025
