# **Randomizer for The Crew Motorfest Grand Races**
<br>Available categories are:
<br>Street Tier1 / Street Tier2 / Hypercar / Drift / Racing / AGP / Motocross / Rally / Rally Raid / Monster Truck
<br>
<br>For Drift there are only a few cars available at the moment(Hoonigan & Mitsubishi).
<br>This is because stearing will block for most of the other drift cars when using direct mode or a high dynamic maxlock value. More cars may be added later.
<br>
<br>Thank you [@wbcolon](https://github.com/wbcolon) for integrating the Grandrace rotation and automatic match of categories. 
<br>And of course to the [motorfe.st project](https://github.com/calamity-inc/motorfe.st/) for the rotation logic itself.
