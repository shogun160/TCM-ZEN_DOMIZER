# **Randomizer for The Crew Motorfest Grand Races** *(click picture above to start)*

**Available categories** *(TIP: Sort your vehicles by brand)*  
🚘 Street Tier 1 🚘 Street Tier 2 🚘 Hypercar 🚘 Drift 🚘 Racing 🚘 AGP 🚘 Motocross 🚘 Rally 🚘 Rally Raid 🚘 Monster Truck 🚘

⚠️ *For Drift there are only a few cars available at the moment (Hoonigan & most Mitsubishi). This is because steering will block for most other drift cars when using direct mode or high dynamic maxlock. More cars may be added later.*

Thanks to [@wbcolon](https://github.com/wbcolon) for integrating the Grandrace rotation and automatic matching categories.  
And of course a special thank also to the [motorfe.st project](https://github.com/calamity-inc/motorfe.st/) for the rotation logic itself.

**Version:** v2.7
**Carlist:** Season 6 – 03.09.2025
