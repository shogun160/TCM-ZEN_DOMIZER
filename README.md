# **Randomizer for The Crew Motorfest Grand Races**
<br>Available categories are:
<br>Street Tier1 / Street Tier2 / Hypercar / Racing / AGP / Motocross / Rally / Rally Raid / Monster Truck
<br>
<br>For Drift there are only a few cars available at the moment(Hoonigan & Mitsubishi).
<br>This is because stearing of most of the other drift cars will block when using direct mode or a high dynamic maxlock value. More cars may be added later.
<br>
<br>Thank you @wbcolon for Integration the Grandrace rotation and automatic match of categories.
